## Basic AMD ES6 SPA

This is an experimental project motivated by an urge to escape from the
overhead of everyday complexities coming from _"traditional"_ application
development. Meanwhile exploring the _"AMD-way"_ of doing things.

### Getting started
```
npm install
```

### Scripts
```
npm run lint
```

### Usage
You can try it out by opening `index.html` in your browser. No build
steps are required, and I'll try to keep things this way.

### Credits
Inspired by: [Build a simple client-side MVC app with RequireJS](http://verekia.com/requirejs/build-simple-client-side-mvc-app-require-js/);
